# OmniCoder-AGI Self-Upgrade Prompt Template
# ==========================================
#
# Copy this file to 'self-upgrade-prompt.txt' and add your upgrade instructions.
# The 'self-upgrade-prompt.txt' file is gitignored to prevent accidental secret exposure.
#
# Usage:
#   cp self-upgrade-prompt.template.txt self-upgrade-prompt.txt
#   # Edit self-upgrade-prompt.txt with your instructions
#   python -m cli.omnicoder_agi upgrade --from-file self-upgrade-prompt.txt --auto
#
# IMPORTANT: Never put secrets (PAT tokens, API keys) in this file!
# Use the --token flag or environment variables instead:
#   export GITHUB_PAT=your_token
#   python -m cli.omnicoder_agi upgrade --from-file self-upgrade-prompt.txt --auto
#
# Or pass the token directly (it will be filtered from logs):
#   python -m cli.omnicoder_agi upgrade --from-file self-upgrade-prompt.txt --token YOUR_TOKEN --auto
